WIND WEEK#43 OCT-22
M| A pink patch of stunning cloud presented at twilight is well worth the tolerance put up with the early summer heat.
T| When calm sunshine of twilight lighting up your running face, how can any worrying of the day still worth the time.
W| Copious clouds blocking sunset takeover the night brought sweeping wind howling in the ears of runners on the move.
T| Is it too amiable the twilight or too quick the sun has set, darkness curtains the crew before reaching the bucket.
F| Leave dancing in summer breeze outside the glass of insulated gym wondering how did I end up there inside sweating.
S| Brilliant contrast of tender sunlight that illuminates the bay almost glorified the runners there early of the day.
S| The cooling down of the night was unperceptibly sharp that a ten minutes brisk walk feeling even colder afterwards.
